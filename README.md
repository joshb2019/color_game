## Description
This game is one of the projects that is part of the course the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/" target="_blank">Web Developer's Bootcamp.</a> I modified it in several ways. There is now a hover effect. There are three difficulty settings. There is a help button with information about the game. I also went about implementing the basic game functionality differently in various places than the instructor did. 

## Dependencies
This game requires Bootstrap (both CSS and JS). Bootstrap requires jQuery and Popper.js as dependencies.
